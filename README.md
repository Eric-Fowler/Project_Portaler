2D Platformer Based on portal gun concept

May consider adding other gun-related mechanics in the future.

# Key attributes
* Smooth controls
* Quick/Fast gameplay

Ideally want to encourage players to always keep moving quickly. Encourage conserving momentum.
* Level exploration

Levels will most likely be linear or linear with multiple endings.

# Game Type:
* Standard 2D Platformer (like Celeste)

Probably would be a tiny bit more puzzle-based than Celste is. Room for minor-medium amounts of combat.

Consider adding room for inspiration from super mario bros games.

* MMO (unlikely)

It would probably be unique from normal MMOs because rather than using guns, players would complete objectives by movement and using momentum to attack. For example, players would be fighting a massive boss (think Shadow of the Colossus) and break off its arm by all slamming into its elbow joint at the same time. The support classes could place acceleration gates that would enable the heavier classes to gain large momentum and deal a lot of damage.

# Potential Adds:
* Infinite-length (like Temple Run or Subway Surfers) gamemode
* Character Classes
